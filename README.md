# Sales-Dashboard

ðŸš€ Excited to share my Power BI Sales Dashboard!
 From messy data to meaningful insights â€“ this dashboard was a great learning experience. It might be simple, but itâ€™s special as it teaches me a lot.

What I did:
 Built an interactive Sales Dashboard in Power BI that tracks:
âœ”  Sales trends by year, quarter, category
âœ” Region-wise performance
âœ”  Profitability by sub-category
âœ” KPIs for total sales, quantity, customers, and more

This project helped me sharpen my skills in:
 âœ” Data cleaning & transformation
 âœ” Played around with slicers, KPIs, and charts to make it interactive and fun!
âœ” Building insights across sales, profit, regions, and categories
âœ” Business insight generation

Tools used: Power BI, Excel

I'm working toward a role in data analytics and would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.
